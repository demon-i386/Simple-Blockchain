# Description
  
  a simple blockchain code where I make a chain of blocks connected to each other, 
  if a data changes a hash (signature) will change, in other words, every 
  block linked to it will change, thus forming the blockchain 
  
  feel free to edit the code or else make commit I will be accepting 
  all commits that will add something to the blockchain... I plan in 
  the future to make a simple p2p network
